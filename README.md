# 🤖 ClapTrap – Voice-Controlled Assistant Inspired by Borderlands

**ClapTrap** (aka _"Железяка"_) is an open-source prototype of an intelligent voice-controlled assistant, inspired by the iconic robot from the Borderlands video game series. This assistant is designed for **audio-driven system control**, with support for **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and future **camera-based user authentication**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a foundation for developing **audio-based automation systems** with plans for:

- ✅ Offline **speech recognition** using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)
- ✅ Offline **text-to-speech** via [Silero TTS](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models)
- 🧠 Integration with a **custom LLM-based AI brain** (in development)
- 📷 **User identification** via camera and face recognition (planned)
- 📱 **Mobile support** and web-based visual UI (future release)

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🎤 Wake-word activation (e.g., "Железяка", "Робот", "Железный человек")
- 🔊 Real-time command recognition and execution
- 🗣 Voice replies using natural speech synthesis
- 🧠 Modular and extendable command processing logic
- 🖥 Visual interface and identity recognition in the roadmap

---

## 🧠 Project Vision

ClapTrap is not just a toy assistant. The long-term vision includes:

-AI-driven personality inspired by Borderlands' Claptrap
-Personalized responses based on face and voice recognition
-Full offline control and autonomy
-Seamless expansion to smart devices, robotics, or embedded systems
